# oauth2-lib

<a href="http://mikedilger.github.io/oauth2-lib">Documentation</a>

This is an OAuth 2.0 library for the Rust language.  It defines types and
traits useful for implementing an OAuth 2.0 compliant system as specified by
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>.

The current implementation allows you to build the most common and most secure
type of OAuth 2.0 infrastructure, but is not complete, and may not be
absolutely correct.  Please file bug reports or pull requests if you notice
any deviation from RFC 6749, or if you have any other issues.

## Stability Note

This library is still undergoing heavy upheaval.  I don't
recommend using it yet unless you are a masochist.  -Mike, 25 May 2016
